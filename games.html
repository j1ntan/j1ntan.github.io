          <p class="section__text__p3">I have been into video games since when i was in 10th grade(ofc due to lockdown). I mostly played fps(first person shooter) multiplayer games like csgo(cs2 now) and valorant. I did also play many singlplayer games like gta 5, hades, undertale, nfs payback, dying light and many more! Even though i'm not good at gaming i still like to play them as a stressbuster :) </p>
